## ‚ö°Ô∏èAbout The Project
This is the rest API caller project for calling many types of API endpoints. <br>
This is demo project and so, I don't add any other logic like communication with db, etc.
So, you will see hard coded values in service class. <br>
This service will call to receiver service [RestAPI Sample Receiver Service](https://github.com/yewin-mm/restapi-sample-receiver-service),
so, you need to run that receiver service first in your machine. <br>
You can learn how to call that many types of API endpoints by using RestTemplate in this project. <br>
You can learn how to call many types of API endpoints by using RestTemplate in this project like below,
1. Calling APIs which need to add Request as APIs requirements
2. Calling APIs which need to get (catch) Response data from APIs responses
3. Calling APIs which need to add Request and catch Response data as API requirements (this is the main point and to learn that calling APIs, you need to learn above step 1 and 2 first)
4. Calling APIs which need to handle Error Response from APIs responses (this is for handling Error Response)
